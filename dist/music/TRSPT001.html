<p>I am one of three members of a group called Transept, and this was our debut album. We wrote, mixed and produced it ourselves.</p><p>Artrocker, Word, Mojo, Uncut and Rock-a-rolla gave it four stars.</p><p>Artrocker called it <q>“a stunning piece of progressive space-rock melancholia”</q>.</p><p>Total Music said it sounds like <q>“Fuck Buttons jamming with Acid Mothers Temple or Amon Düül ”</q>.</p><p>Following its release, we played support slots for Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Walls and Islet.</p><p>I designed the <a class=lightbox href="#transept-trspt001">logo and artwork</a>. We screenprinted the covers.</p><div class=lightbox-content id=transept-trspt001><img alt="" data-src="/image/13cc.transept_trspt001_front.png"><img alt="" data-src="/image/ebec.transept_trspt001_back.png"><img alt="" data-src="/image/ad06.transept_trspt001_rmx.png"></div>
