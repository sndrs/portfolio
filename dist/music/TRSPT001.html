<p>I&#8217;m one of 3 members of Transept, and this was our debut album. We wrote, mixed and produced it ourselves.</p><p>Artrocker, Word, Mojo, Uncut and Rock-a-rolla gave it ★★★★.</p><p>Artrocker called it<q>“a stunning piece of progressive space-rock melancholia”</q>.</p><p>Total Music said it sounds like<q>“Fuck Buttons jamming with Acid Mothers Temple or Amon Düül ”</q>.</p><p>On the back of it we supported GY!BE, Walls and Islet.</p><p>I designed the <a data-fancy-content=transept-trspt001>logo and artwork</a>. We screen-printed the covers.</p><div class=fancy-content id=transept-trspt001><img alt="" data-src="/image/13cc.transept_trspt001_front.png"><img alt="" data-src="/image/ebec.transept_trspt001_back.png"><img alt="" data-src="/image/ad06.transept_trspt001_rmx.png"></div>
