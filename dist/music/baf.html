<p>Transept&#8217;s second album, mixed with Luke Abbott.</p><p>The Quietus loved it, running an exclusive on the video Dan Tombs made for a track from it, and publishing <a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/11715-transept-interview">a long interview</a> with us.</p><p>Electronic Sound said<q>“The genius cannot be understated”</q>and Tiny Mix Tapes described it as<q>“akin to pushing your fists into a bathtub full of ground beef”</q>.</p><p>I designed the <a data-fancy-content=transept-baf>logo and artwork</a> again. We mono-printed the background of covers with an open screen, but the fine printing was done professionally.</p><p>I also treated the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9uwzsezxv7fg3dg/UDgTBMI5Mm">press shots</a> and created a minisite to promote the release.</p><div class=fancy-content id=transept-baf><img alt="" data-src="/image/8da2.transept_baf_1.jpg"><img alt="" data-src="/image/6354.transept_baf_2.jpg"><img alt="" data-src="/image/f105.transept_baf_4.png"><img alt="" data-src="/image/c23e.transept_baf_3.png"></div>
