<p>The second album by my band Transept (see below), mixed with Luke Abbott.</p><p>The Quietus loved it, running an exclusive on the video Dan Tombs made for a track from it, and publishing <a href="http://thequietus.com/articles/11715-transept-interview">a long interview</a> with us.</p><p>Electronic Sound said <q>“The genius cannot be understated”</q> and Tiny Mix Tapes described it as <q>“akin to pushing your fists into a bathtub full of ground beef”</q>.</p><p>I designed the <a data-fancy-content=transept-baf>artwork and packaging</a>. We monoprinted the background of the covers with an open screen, but the fine printing was done professionally.</p><p>I also treated the <a data-fancy-content=transept-press>press shots</a> and created a minisite to promote the release.</p><div class=fancy-content id=transept-press><img alt="" data-src="/image/5b81.transept_press_2.jpg"><img alt="" data-src="/image/1c50.transept_press_1.jpg"><img alt="" data-src="/image/3f98.transept_press_3.jpg"></div><div class=fancy-content id=transept-baf><img alt="" data-src="/image/8da2.transept_baf_1.jpg"><img alt="" data-src="/image/f105.transept_baf_4.png"><img alt="Paul at Soundclash Music in Norwich disguising his face with the Buff as Fuck vinyl in the Guardian." data-src="/image/c23e.transept_baf_3.png"></div>
