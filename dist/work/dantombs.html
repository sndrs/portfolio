<p>Dan creates glitch-based videos and live visuals for the likes of Factory Floor, Luke Abbott and Jon Hopkins, among many others.</p><p>We wanted to create a site that would show his work by reflecting his aesthetic, rather than a straightforward source of graphical and textual information.</p><p>Originally the site pulled content from a live Google search from Node.js – effectively glitching the data on Dan that was already present on the Internet – but it became too difficult to target the results Dan wanted. Instead, he maintains a list of URLs from a Google alert.</p><p>It&#8217;s deliberately built with slightly sub-optimal methods (e.g.<code>setTimeout</code>vs<code>requestAnimationFrame</code>) to increase the chances of the viewer&#8217;s browser glitching itself, enforcing the aesthetic.</p>
