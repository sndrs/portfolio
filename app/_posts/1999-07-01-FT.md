First job from university, creating illustrative graphics for articles on FT.com.

After 5 months I moved to product development, where two of us worked with designers from Razorfish to co-design a new interface and IA for the site. 

We then coded the client-side of what became the first, recognisable online version of the paper (using `<table>` and `<font>` tags).

Responsible for page layout and site consistency, usability and compatibility.
