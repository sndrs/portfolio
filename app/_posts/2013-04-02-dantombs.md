Dan creates glitch-based music videos and live visuals for the likes of Factory Floor, Luke Abbott and Jon Hopkins, among many others.

We wanted to create a site that would show Dan's work by reflecting his aesthetic, rather than build a straightforward source of graphical and textual information. 

Originally the site pulled content from a live Google search in Node.js—effectively glitching the data on Dan that was already present on the internet—but it became too difficult to target the results Dan wanted. Instead, he maintains a list of URLs from a Google alert.

It's deliberately built with slightly sub-optimal methods (e.g. <kbd>setTimeout</kbd>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<kbd>requestAnimationFrame</kbd>) to increase the chances of the viewer's browser glitching itself, enforcing the aesthetic.
