In this property search start-up, with a four-person development team, I was responsible for the design and build of the UI, using an existing style guide.

I developed a drag-based search mechanism for Google Maps and a prototypical endless-scroll mechanism for lists of results (both of which were the first that we had seen) and a draggable price range selector.

Being able to switch between a map and a list had unpredictable side effects, so I <a data-fancy-content="globrix-designs">developed a concept</a> that would display and search for properties by list and by map simultaneously.

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-designs">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_designs_1.png" alt="" />
</div>

I created the <a data-fancy-content="globrix-ad-style">house advertising style</a> and <a data-fancy-content="globrix-times-ad">ads for The Times</a>.

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-ad-style">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_ad_1.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_ad_2.png" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-times-ad">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_times_ad.png" alt="" />
</div>

In 2010 I <a data-fancy-content="globrix-iphone-app">designed and developed an iPhone app</a>, using Appcelerator Titanium. The requirement was dropped as it entered beta testing and it was never released.

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-iphone-app">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_1.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_2.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_3.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_4.png" alt="The property image rotates by a tiny, random amount. This creates the impression of it having been ‘dropped’ onto the screen." />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_5.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_6.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_7.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_8.png" alt="" />
</div>

Globrix was subsequently acquired and shut down by Zoopla.
