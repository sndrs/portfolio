A property search start-up, with 4-person development team, in which I had responsibility for the design and build of the UI (from a style guide).

We developed a drag-based search mechanism for Google Maps (the first that we'd seen), and I developed a prototypical endless-scroll mechanism for lists of results and a draggable price range selector. 

Proper web 2.0&hellip;

We struggled with users being able to switch between a map and list and the problems that caused, so I <a data-fancy-content="globrix-designs">came up with a concept</a> that would enable displaying results by list and map simultaneously, but it never made it.

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-designs">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_designs_1.png" alt="" />
</div>

I also developed a <a data-fancy-content="globrix-ad-style">house advertising style</a> and <a data-fancy-content="globrix-times-ad">ads for The Times</a> (thanks to a friendly investor arrangement).

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-ad-style">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_ad_1.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_ad_2.png" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-times-ad">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_times_ad.png" alt="" />
</div>

In 2010 I <a data-fancy-content="globrix-iphone-app">designed and developed an iPhone app</a>, using Appcelerator Titanium. Unfortunately, the requirement was dropped as it entered beta testing and it was never released.

<div class="fancy-content" id="globrix-iphone-app">
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_1.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_2.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_3.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_4.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_5.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_6.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_7.png" alt="" />
  <img data-src="/image/globrix_iphone_8.png" alt="" />
</div>

It was subsequently bought and shut down by Zoopla.
