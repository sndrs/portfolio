Re-joined many of the FT.com project team to take overall responsibility for UI/UX and client-side code on the UK launch of TheStreet.com(.co.uk).

Led a complete redesign and build, that took revenues beyond the forecasts.

The shuttering of the .co.uk—due largely to the under-performing .com—was one of the first closures to mark bursting of the .COM bubble :-)
