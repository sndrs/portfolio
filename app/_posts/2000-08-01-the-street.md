I was invited to join many of my former FT.com colleagues (see below) at the launch of TheStreet.co.uk, the UK sister of TheStreet.com. 

I took overall responsibility for UI/UX and client-side code, and led a complete redesign and build, which took revenues beyond the forecasts.

I also designed a series of twenty adverts for display on the London Underground and across the web.
