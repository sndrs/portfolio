The second album by my band Transept (see below), mixed with Luke Abbott.

The Quietus loved it, running an exclusive on the video Dan Tombs made for a track from it, and publishing [a long interview](http://thequietus.com/articles/11715-transept-interview) with us. 

Electronic Sound said <q>“The genius cannot be understated”</q> and Tiny Mix Tapes described it as <q>“akin to pushing your fists into a bathtub full of ground beef”</q>. 

I designed the <a data-fancy-content="transept-baf">logo and artwork</a>. We monoprinted the background of the covers with an open screen, but the fine printing was done professionally. 

I also treated the [press shots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9uwzsezxv7fg3dg/UDgTBMI5Mm) and created a minisite to promote the release.
