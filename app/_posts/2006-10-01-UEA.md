Awarded a distinction.

My composition for twelve airhorns—called *Airhorns*—opened the inaugural Faster Than Sound festival at Bentwaters airbase in Suffolk.

I also designed <a data-fancy-content="uea-conrad">a poster and signage</a> for a performance we organised by composer Tony Conrad.

<div class="fancy-content" id="uea-conrad">

</div>
