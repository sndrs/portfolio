I am one of three members of Transept, and this was our debut album. We wrote, mixed and produced it ourselves. 

Artrocker, Word, Mojo, Uncut and Rock-a-rolla gave it four stars. 

Artrocker called it <q>“a stunning piece of progressive space-rock melancholia”</q>.

Total Music said it sounds like <q>“Fuck Buttons jamming with Acid Mothers Temple or Amon Düül ”</q>.

Following its release, we played support slots for Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Walls and Islet.

I designed the <a data-fancy-content="transept-trspt001">logo and artwork</a>. We screenprinted the covers.
